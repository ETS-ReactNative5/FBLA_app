App for FBLA-PBL App Design 2019-2020

Creators: Ethan Schnathorst and Evan Sonin

We used a mobile app development framework developed by Facebook called React Native to create this app. React Native allows for the creation of native mobile applications across platforms while sharing over 70% of the codebase. It utilizes a mixture of JavaScript (using the React.js library) and native code (Swift/Objective-C for iOS and Java/Kotlin for Android). Countless popular mobile applications have been developed using this framework, such as Discord, Instagram, Facebook, AirBnB, and UberEats.

This app should work on both iOS and Android, although it was designed for iOS so it may run more smoothly and look slightly better on iPhones than Android devices. However, this app is perfectly capable of running on both platforms, as well as tablets.

This app also has the ability to adapt to the color scheme of the device it's being run on (i.e. dark mode or light mode), but a reopening of the app is required for the changes to take effect.
